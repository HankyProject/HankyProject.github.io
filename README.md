# The Hanky project

Welcome to The Hanky project.

The Hanky ​​project was originally a personal project of [Aaron Chan](https://github.com/usaronchan). Now it is part of the open source project.

There are two versions of The Hanky project. One is a repository named [hanky](https://github.com/HankyProject/hanky), which is the second version of hanky and is used as an introductory textbook for mathematics majors. The other is a repository named [hanky-v3](https://github.com/HankyProject/hanky-v3), which is a popular science book on the history of mathematics and is suitable for novices who have no mathematical foundation.
